### Ultimate server by carcaschoi
ä¸€ one of the parts of [ShallowSea AIO Package](https://github.com/carcaschoi/ShallowSea) Project
### Introduction & Features
** JUST IN CASE, IT IS NOT A TINFOIL SHOP
* It only redirects to other alternative shops automatically, so you don't need to add shop manually if the shop links are updated.
* User friendlyï¼Ÿï¼Ÿ

# How to use
Firstly, you must jailbreak your own nintendo switch

You are recommend to delete file [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] before adding server

Just Add this Ulimate server in [tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io). It will auto add and update all of the alternative shops.
