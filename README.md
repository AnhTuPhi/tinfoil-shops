# Introduction & Features

#### *WARNING, Luffshop IS NOT A TINFOIL SHOP it is a FORWADER, It does NOT host games, Luffshop redirects to other available tinfoil shops automatically, so you don't need to add each shop manually and automatically updates links if the shop are added/updated. We are NOT responsible for the GAMES found on TINFOIL by adding this Forwarder.

# Requirements

* Nintendo Switch running CFW ([Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases) with [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases) recommended)

* Relies on [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io) 

* You are recommended to DELETE the current Tinfoil locations.conf [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] from your SD card before adding server.

* To avoid getting banned make sure you have already setup [Exosphere / DNS MITM (click here for the guide)](https://rentry.org/ExosphereDNSMITM).

## FAQs

Q: I have already added Luffshop, but why no shop is loaded?

> A: This usually occurs when the time of your switch does not the same as the real-time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your switch. Or The shops you are trying to access could be down currently.


Q: I can't open tinfoil... :(

> A: Make sure that you install the latest [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases/latest) in your switch.


Q: network error 7 occurs?

> A: Maybe it is a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, you can try to reinsert it.
