So, you cannot search new things when its server is down.\n\nYou may add ReDUMP Shop yourselves but someone reports that it causes a slow boot of tinfoil. Disable it with airplane mode if you find that there is an issue.\n\n** Make sure that you have already setup Oauth before you download XXX from shops.\nSetup guide: https://bit.ly/38HEr48"
